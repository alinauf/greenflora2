                        The Maldives consists of 1,192 coral islands grouped in a chain of 26 atolls, along he
                        north-south direction, spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometers, making this one of the
                        world’s most dispersed countries and 185 of the islands are inhabited by 447,137 people.

                    <p>
                        Maldives islands are so unique that there is no second place that can be compared. First of all
                        the Maldives is a 100% Muslim country. The country is formed on tiny small islands, which are
                        separated by the ocean and each island is about an average of 0.6km length. 99% of the country
                        is ocean and 1% is the land. It is the lowest country in the world and the smallest in Asia. It
                        also holds 5% of the total corals in the world and is a home for 1000s of rare species. The
                        white beaches, sandbanks, crystal clear water, blue sky, and equator, the list can go on. So if
                        you want to visit first thing you need to do is ask some questions like the following:

                        Where to stay in the Maldives?
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        Choosing a place or a hotel to stay can be a very difficult decision for first-time visitors.
                        What are the best places to stay? Which is cheapest place to stay? Where is best budget hotel?
                        The answer to all these question is: It all depends on the purpose, length, budget, of your
                        travel, every place, hotels, and islands has its advantages and disadvantages. Before you jump
                        to any conclusion, we want to tell you that, you will find almost everywhere in the Maldives it
                        is the same type of white beaches, sandbanks, clear water, rich marine life, corals and clear
                        sky; Having that still, some atolls and islands can be little better than one another in terms
                        of sea creatures, coral reefs, and location. Examples (Baa Atll is considered as the biosphere
                        reserve {a cleaning station for the whales and mantas). Whale sharks are most commonly found in
                        Ari Atoll, the deepest and best diving spots are in Faafu Atoll, The best place for fishing,
                        Huvadhoo Atoll and for surfers, it is Kaafu Atoll. Bio luminous planktons (glowing beaches) are
                        common in Raa Atoll) Note* The Maldives is divided into 26 geographical locations also called
                        Atoll.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        Now you might think ok that is not a problem, “ I will visit all these Atolls!” Well, it is not
                        possible to move between the atolls unless you have along vacation and lots of money? First of
                        all, there is not transportation network that covers the entire Maldives. One can focus on this
                        topic on “how to travel around by public transportation?”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the Maldives the word “Hotels” is mostly referred to as city or island accommodations
                        guesthouses and resorts are call to private islands also managed by hoteliers. These are the
                        main two types of accommodation. The difference is between them is huge and vital to know before
                        you make a decision.

                        Maldives Resorts
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        These are private islands that have been leased by the government of the Maldives to private
                        companies for the purpose of tourism-based activities. Therefore the entire island is leased for
                        one company most. Unlike local island guesthouses, you can find bars, clubs, DJ partiers,
                        massage parlors, diving schools with many activities, and bikini is allowed on these islands.
                        There are mainly 3 categories of rooms on these islands and are (Garden rooms, beach rooms,
                        overwater room} The number of rooms on each island varies, an average 80-120 rooms. These
                        islands are full of privacy and less crowded. That is why it’s the best place for relaxing,
                        especially for those who live in busy cities; this is a place you need. That is also why many
                        famous celebrities, athletes, and royals visit these islands. Like we mentioned each island is
                        separated by the ocean, so even the government authorities need a special warrant to enter these
                        private islands. There are over 132 resorts in the country and the prices to stay in a resort
                        will cost you an average 600$ per night. Most of these islands are 5-star properties, but there
                        are some 4 star and 3-star islands.

                    <p>
                        These guest houses or hotels are located on the local island. Until 2010 there were no hotels in
                        the local islands as it was prohibited by the law of the country but as backpackers, students,
                        and many people cannot afford these resorts the government decided to allow them to visit and
                        stay with locals with special conditions. That is to obey and respect the law and local culture
                        of the country. Which means no, no alcohol, no public kissing, no pork, and no pets are allowed
                        on these islands. The first island to open with this project is called Maafushi island and today
                        we have more than 70 (3-star hotels) in Maafushi. Having that restriction, all these local
                        island hotels are categorized as 3 star properties. Travelers who travel for (budgets, family,
                        honeymoon, and local stays) can stay in these locals islands. The most famous local islands to
                        visit can be ( Maafushi, Gulhi, Dhiffushi, Guraidhoo, Thulusdhoo, Huraa). These islands are also
                        in Male’ Atoll, which saves some travelling expenses and time. The average hotel rates are
                        between 60-1000$ per night. These hotels are the bet for long staying guests and culture
                        explorers. Book a city hotel.

                        How to travel around by public transportations?

                    <p>
                        There is no transportation network that connects the entire Maldives. Part of the country is
                        connected by planes and another part is connected by sea transportation. To visit an island, you
                        need either a ferry boat or a plane transfer. The most used transportation is the ferry boat
                        transfers as these are the cheapest which are find for a shot distance and good weather. To
                        travel from one atoll to another atoll the boats will take up to 3-24 hours even the speed boat
                        takes 1-6 hours and during the bad weather, many boats will not travel. That is why there are no
                        reliable boats to travel across the country. However, there is an internal ferry network for
                        each atoll, which in some regions operates daily one ferry and some regions weekly one or two
                        (these internal ferry boats also take around 2-5hrs to the most distant islands in the atoll).
                        Also, there are some private speed boat transfers, which are fast and convenient, costs around
                        (20-50$ pp) takes around 30-50mn to the most distant island in the atoll.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are only very few islands that can be visited by domestic planes. The domestic flights are
                        operated to transfer between Atoll, most of the domestic airports are located in uninhabited
                        islands, then again from domestic airport you will need another boat transfer to the islands
                        located in the Atolls.

                        and land directly to most resorts and islands. Private charters are also available. The cost for
                        tickets depends on the travel destinations (to the nearest Atoll is around 500-600$ PP) and
                        private charter seaplane can be around 1000$ for the close by atolls.

                        Is it safe to visit Maldives?
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        Yes, it is very safe place,. According to some reports, it is the safest place in Asia for
                        tourists. Despite being a 100% Muslim country, the government is very flexible with tourists,
                        every day you can find tourists who don’t follow the rules and law, but no actions are taken. In
                        fact, the tourists are more protected than the citizens. If a citizen is caught in a non-smoking
                        area, there will be immediate fine, while tourists are always advised to stop smoking in the
                        area, public kissing and many other behaviors are against the culture and law, yet you will find
                        some tourists these behaviors in public. Even its mention very clear bikini is not allowed in
                        city or island beaches, but here are some tourists who doesn’t follow these rules. That’s will
                        because the entire economy of the country depends on tourism and if the government is strict on
                        these no wonder tourists will not feel happy. However there is something to keep in mind, and
                        that is the weather and ocean current. If you are a non-swimmer, do not go to the sea for
                        yourself and even if you are a good swimmer it’s highly recommended to wear life jackets. The
                        current inside the channel can take you out of the atoll within few minutes. SO you must daily
                        check the tides and current flow of the sea, before you jump in. You don’t have to worry about
                        sharks or other creatures in the sea, current is the most dangerous.

                    <p>
                        Because of the disparity, it is not possible to visit many islands and even if you have enough
                        money and time, it is not recommended to visit as many islands as possible, since they all looks
                        the same. But there must be some places to visit right? If you can afford we would suggest you
                        to consider this: Remember the Maldives is full of surprises anywhere you go on an adventure
                        trip, there are almost 80-90 chance you will find something amazing.

                        As mentioned above the countries 99% is the ocean and, therefore most of the tourist activities
                        are water-based activities. So if you are swimmer you can do (snorkeling, diving, kayak riding,
                        surfing, jet ski riding etc. ) if you are non-swimmer you can still do some activities too like:
                        (whale submarine tour, sunset cruise, dolphin cruise, city tour, island hopping, day visits to
                        resorts etc.

                        2 monsoons and both monsoons have sun. The first monsoon (North East) is from November to May
                        and (South West) is from June to October. North-East monsoon is considered as most sunny days
                        and the best time for fishing, snorkeling, and activities and for visiting. South West is
                        considered as less sunny and more raining days. When the weather is bad, the sea also becomes
                        rough and difficult for water-based activities, that’s why we recommend all travelers to check
